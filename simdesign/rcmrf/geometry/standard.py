class StandardFrame(FrameBase):
    """
    Class representing a standard frame structure.

    This class inherits from FrameBase and extends it to represent a
    standard frame structure. It initializes the frame with the given
    parameters and constructs the base geometry of the frame. It is
    called StandardFrame because its base geometry is built as a
    uniform and regular frame (equal bay widths and storey heights).

    Parameters
    ----------
    num_storeys : int
        The number of storeys in the frame.
    storey_height : float
        The height of each storey.
    num_bays_x : int
        The number of bays along the x-direction.
    bay_width_x : float
        The width of each bay along the x-direction.
    num_bays_y : int
        The number of bays along the y-direction.
    bay_width_y : float
        The width of each bay along the y-direction.

    Attributes
    ----------
    _num_storeys : int
        The number of storeys in the frame.
    _num_bays_x : int
        The number of bays along the x-direction.
    _num_bays_y : int
        The number of bays along the y-direction.
    _storey_height : float
        The height of each storey.
    _bay_width_x : float
        The width of each bay along the x-direction.
    _bay_width_y : float
        The width of each bay along the y-direction.

    Methods
    -------
    __init__
        Initializes the StandardFrame with the given parameters.
    __str__
        Returns a string representation of the StandardFrame.
    _initialise_points
        Initializes the points of the frame.
    _initialise_lines
        Initializes the lines of the frame.
    _initialise_rectangles
        Initializes the rectangles of the frame.
